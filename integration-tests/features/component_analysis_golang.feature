    Scenario: Check the component analysis V2 REST API Batch Call for Golang ecosystem
        Given System is running
        Given Three scale preview service is running

        When I acquire the use_key for 3scale
        Then I should get the proper user_key
        When I start CA batch call for test_golang_3.json with user_key
        Then I should get 200 status code
        And I should receive a valid JSON response
        Then I should be able to validate all the feilds or vulnerablities in the result
        And I should find package github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/pkg/restore@github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero 1.5.2 has no recommendation
        And I should find package github.com/rancher/rancher/pkg/controllers/user/rbac@github.com/rancher/rancher 2.1.3 has v2.5.2-rc6 recommended version
        Then I should find snyk id SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMULIKUNITZXZ-598892 and 7.5 for package github.com/ulikunitz/xz and version 0.5.4
        Then I should find snyk id SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMGRAVITATIONALTELEPORTLIBCLIENT-564514 for package github.com/gravitational/teleport/lib/client and version 0.2.1 as private
        And I should not find any registered user fields

    Scenario Outline: Check if module vulnerable and package not vulnerable vice versa
        Given System is running
        Given Three scale preview service is running

        When I acquire the use_key for 3scale
        Then I should get the proper user_key

        And I should find package  <package> <version> has no recommendation
        And I should find package <package2> <version2>  has <recommended> recommended version
        Then I should find snyk id <snykid> and <score> for package <package2> and version <version2>

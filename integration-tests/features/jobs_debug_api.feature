    Given System is running
    Given Jobs debug API is running
    When I acquire job API authorization token
    Then I should get the proper job API authorization token
    When I access jobs API /api/v1/debug/github-tokens with authorization token
    Then I should get 200 status code
    Then I should see proper information about job API tokens

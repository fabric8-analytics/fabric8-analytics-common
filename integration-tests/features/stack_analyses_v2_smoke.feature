Feature: Smoketests for stack analysis V2 API tests

  @sav2
  Scenario Outline: Check the stack analysis smoke test for <ecosystem> package with <file>
    Given System is running
    Given Three scale preview service is running
    When I acquire the use_key for 3scale
    Then I should get the proper user_key

    # request the stack analysis
    When I wait 3 seconds
    When I send <ecosystem> package request with manifest <file> to stack analysis v2 with valid user key
    Then I should get 200 status code
     And I should receive JSON response containing the status key
     And I should receive JSON response containing the id key
     And I should receive JSON response containing the submitted_at key
     And I should receive JSON response with the status key set to success
     And I should receive JSON response with the correct id
     And I should receive JSON response with the correct timestamp in attribute submitted_at

    # Wait for response from stack analysis
    When I wait for stack analysis v2 to finish with user key

    # Request ID check
    Then I should find the external request id equals to id returned by stack analysis v2 post request

    # Check all parameters of response including timestamp
     And I should get stack analyses v2 response with all attributes

    # SLA/SLO-related checks
    # TODO :: Need to move this check to a seperate load test.
    #When I look at the stack analysis duration
    #Then I should see that the duration is less than 120 seconds

    # Analyzed direct dependencies checks
    When I look at recent stack analysis
    Then I should find <analyzed_deps_count> analyzed dependencies for stack analyses v2

    # Unknown dependencies checks
    # TODO :: This are disabled till support for a flag in platform to ignore dummy
    # unknown dependency ingestion.
    #When I look at recent stack analysis
    #Then I should find <unknown_deps_count> unknown dependencies for stack analyses v2

    # Check license count
    When I look at recent stack analysis
    Then I should find <unknown_license_count> unknown licenses for stack analyses v2
     And I should find <distinct_license_count> distinct licenses for stack analyses v2

    # Verify recommendation data
    When I look at recent stack analysis
    Then I should find <usage_outlier_count> usage outliers for stack analyses v2

    # Verify Free user having registration link.
    When I look at recent stack analysis
    Then I should find registration link for stack analyses v2

    # Analyzed dependencies attribute check
    When I look at recent stack analysis
    Then I should find all attribute about analyzed dependencies for stack analyses v2

Feature: Stack analysis v2 API Golang Ecosystem Tests



    @sav2
    Scenario Outline: Check the stack analysis v2 request and response for proper data
        Given System is running
        Given Three scale preview service is running
        When I acquire the use_key for 3scale
        Then I should get the proper user_key
        When I send golang package request with manifest golist.json to stack analysis v2 with valid user key
        Then I should get 200 status code
        When I wait for stack analysis v2 to finish with user key
        Then I should find the external request id equals to id returned by stack analysis v2 post request
        And I should get stack analyses v2 response with all attributes

    Scenario: Data validation checks for golang ecosystem - public vulnerabilities
        Given System is running
        Given Three scale preview service is running
        When I acquire the use_key for 3scale
        Then I should get the proper user_key
        When I send golang package request with manifest valid_golist.json to stack analysis v2 with valid user key with transitives
        Then I should get 200 status code
        And I should receive JSON response containing the status key
        And I should receive JSON response containing the id key
        And I should receive JSON response containing the submitted_at key
        And I should receive JSON response with the status key set to success
        And I should receive JSON response with the correct id
        And I should receive JSON response with the correct timestamp in attribute submitted_at
        When I wait for stack analysis v2 to finish with user key
        Then I should get stack analyses v2 response with all attributes
        And I should find 0 unknown licenses for stack analyses v2
        And I should find 3 distinct licenses for stack analyses v2
        And I should find distinct license Apache-2.0 for license analysis
        And I should be able to validate github data for all dependencies
        And I should get 4 transitive dependencies for github.com/rancher/rancher/pkg/clusterrouter
        And I should get 4 transitive vulnerabilities for github.com/rancher/rancher/pkg/clusterrouter
        And I should find github.com/moby/moby with upstream/0.1.1 20.10.0-beta1 20.10.0-beta1 with SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMMOBYMOBY-72364 and 7.5 for public vulnerbilities
        And I should find Authentication Bypass and high for github.com/moby/moby in public vulnerbilities
        And I should find License Apache-2.0 for github.com/moby/moby in analyzed dependencies

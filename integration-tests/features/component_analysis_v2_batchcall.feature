    Scenario: Check the component analysis V2 REST API Batch Call for NPM ecosystem
        Given System is running
        Given Three scale preview service is running

        When I acquire the use_key for 3scale
        Then I should get the proper user_key
        When I start CA batch call for test_npm.json with user_key
        Then I should get 200 status code
         And I should receive a valid JSON response
        Then I should be able to validate all the feilds or vulnerablities in the result
        And I should find package sequence 3.0.0 has no recommendation
        And I should find package ejs 1.0.0 has 3.1.3 recommended version
        Then I should find snyk id SNYK-JS-EJS-10218 and 8.1 for package ejs and version 1.0.0
        Then I should find snyk id SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-471882 for package angular and version 1.0.0 as private
